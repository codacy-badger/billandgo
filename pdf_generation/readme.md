To use Mpdf library :

$ composer require mpdf/mpdf

or add this in your composer.json

{
    "require": {
        "mpdf/mpdf": "^7.1"
    }
}

and do composer install

In this example, the css file and the php file are both in the same folder.

the final step is to connect this with our billandgo app.
